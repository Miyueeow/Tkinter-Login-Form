# Tkinter Login Form

This is a simple GUI-based login form built using Python's Tkinter library. The application allows users to:
- Enter a username and password.
- Validate credentials against predefined values (`username="admin"`, `password="1234"`).
- Receive feedback on login success or failure.
- Clear the input fields using the "Clear" button.

## How It Works
1. Run the `login_form.py` file in a Python environment.
2. A window will appear with fields for username and password, along with "Login" and "Clear" buttons.
3. Enter the username and password.
   - If they match the predefined credentials, a success message appears.
   - Otherwise, an error message is displayed.
4. Use the "Clear" button to reset the form.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter library (built into Python standard library)
