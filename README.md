# Tkinter-Login-Form
This is a simple GUI-based login form built using Python's Tkinter library. The application allows users to: - Enter a username and password. - Validate credentials against predefined values (`username="admin"`, `password="1234"`). - Receive feedback on login success or failure. - Clear the input fields using the "Clear" button.
